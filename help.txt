                           ***
Instructions:

By tilting your iPhone left, right, up, and down you aim your dart and align the target.
You "throw" the dart by flicking your finger on the screen... the quicker the flick, the faster the throw.
 
The "Settings" menu offers a choice of three rooms in which to play. You may also adjust the distance to the dart board.
